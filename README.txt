# A Graphics Project

lili means "tiny" in [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).

Here, it means a tiny graphics project.

Currently spawns a window and OPENGL context with SDL. Includes a Makefile for building. To be used as to learn things, and as a base for other bigger things eventually.
