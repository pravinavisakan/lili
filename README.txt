# A Graphics Project

lili means "tiny" in [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).

Here, it means a tiny graphics project and/or framework.

Current progress includes the beginnings of a camera class, able to process keyboard input and freely change the perspective on a scene. Check out the cube demo, which renders a simple cube with this enabled.
